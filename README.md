Registering users / roles / assigning permissions

- still need to work on the project to be able to get more features on it and to be stable. I'm having some issues with listing the users vs registering them. Need to re-create the models individually and update the context.

**Requirement:**

* Consider the following :
  * A user has: name, email, department and password
  * A user can adopt one or more roles
  * There is a hierarchy of roles.
  * By default there are two roles:
   * Employee and Manager
  * Any role will also be an Employee.



  * Users in a role have certain permissions
  * The permissions can be: read, add, update and delete
  * By default a Manager can perform all the operations
  * By default an Employee can only read



* The application must allow:
  * Register users. Verify that there is no other user with the same email.
  * Register roles. Be careful with the inheritance of roles. Don't define recursive roles.
  * Assign permissions to roles
  * Assign roles to users
  * Determine the permissions of a user based on her roles.
  * Notify the Manager that a user has been registered in their department

** how I used it on a new solution:
- clean solution
- build solution
-  Package Manager Console -> update-database

* TEST QUESTIONS:
* Could you explain which design patterns have you used and what is the purpose of them? 
  * Answer: As a design pattern I'd use the "Builder", because builder doesnâ€™t require products to have a common interface. That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.

* If we wanted to persist that information in any storage, could you please explain which type of storage you would choose and how it looks?
  * Answer: I'd use Cloud AWS, despite the cost it's fast.
